        **Model Details:**
        - **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
        - **Features:** TF-IDF Vectorization (100,000 max features)
        - **Training Data:** IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset (40,000 reviews)
        - **Classes:** Binary (Positive/Negative)
        - **Max Iterations:** 5,000
        - **Model Source:** [Hugging Face - MphephuSamuel/testing_models](https://huggingface.co/MphephuSamuel/testing_models)
        
        **How it works:**
        1. Model is downloaded from Hugging Face on first run
        2. Your text is converted to numerical features using TF-IDF
        3. The logistic regression model calculates probabilities
        4. The class with higher probability becomes the prediction
